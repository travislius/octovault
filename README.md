## 🚀 Quick Start

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/travislius/claw-missions.git
cd claw-missions
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:5679` in your browser.

### Native (Python + Node)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/travislius/claw-missions.git
cd claw-missions

# Backend
cd backend && python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt && cd ..

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run build && cd ..

# Configure & run
cp .env.example .env   # Edit with your credentials
./start.sh
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit:

```env
CLAWMISSIONS_USERNAME=admin
CLAWMISSIONS_PASSWORD=changeme       # Use something strong!
CLAWMISSIONS_SECRET=random-string    # openssl rand -hex 32
CLAWMISSIONS_STORAGE=/data/files     # Where files live on disk
CLAWMISSIONS_DB=/data/clawmissions.db
CLAWMISSIONS_MAX_UPLOAD_MB=500
CLAWMISSIONS_PORT=5679
```

> Keep your data directory outside the git repo to avoid committing personal files.

---

## 🌐 Exposing to the Internet

For HTTPS access anywhere, use [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) (free):

```bash
cloudflared tunnel create claw-missions
cloudflared tunnel route dns claw-missions missions.yourdomain.com
```

Or use nginx + Let's Encrypt for a traditional reverse proxy setup.

---

## 📡 REST API

Full REST API — designed for AI agents and automation:

```bash
# Login
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5679/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"changeme"}' | jq -r .access_token)

# Upload a file
curl -X POST http://localhost:5679/api/files/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/document.pdf"

# Search files
curl "http://localhost:5679/api/files/search?q=passport" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Tag a file
curl -X POST http://localhost:5679/api/files/1/tags \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \

  -d '[1, 2]'
```

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend** — React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend** — Python + FastAPI
- **Database** — SQLite via SQLAlchemy
- **Auth** — JWT tokens + bcrypt
- **Storage** — Real filesystem (files are actual files)
- **Container** — Docker + docker-compose

---

## 🔐 Security

Rate limiting, bcrypt password hashing, CORS lockdown, and strong JWT signing are all included. For sensitive deployments, add **Cloudflare Access** as a second auth layer (free tier available).

See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for the full guide.
